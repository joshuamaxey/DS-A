// Write a function, pairSum, that takes in an array and a target sum as arguments. The function should return an array containing a pair of indices whose elements sum to the given target. The indices returned must be unique.

// Be sure to return the indices, not the elements themselves.

// There is guaranteed to be one such pair that sums to the target.

// ! First Solution: Nested loops, TC: O(n^2) SC: O(1)

const pairSum = (numbers, targetSum) => {

    // We want to iterate over the numbers array
    // For each element in the numbers array, we want to iterate over the array again
    // At each iteration, we will check to see if the value of the element at the current index of the first array
    // And the value at the current index of the second array sum together to produce the target value

}
